R code for figures in inhibitor paper

The R code which generates the figures have been broken down into 6 sections.Each section has a code for prokaryotic and eukaryotic community.

a) Section 1

-This section contains the R code for Figure 1 (NMDS for all samples),Figure 2 (Line graph) and Figure S1 (Stressplot for NMDS) and Figure S2 (NMDS plot for urea treated samples only)

b) Section 2

- This section contains the R code for Figure 3 (alpha diversity-Observed species richness) and Figure S3 (alpha diversity- Shannon diversity and Evenness)

c) Section 3

-This section contains the R code for Figure 4 (Relative abundance of taxa)and Figure S4 (Heatmap of communities at all time points)

d) Section 4

-This section contains the R code for Figure 5 (Significant prokaryotic OTU) and Figure 6 (Significant fungal OTU)

e) Section 4a

- This section contains the R code for Figure S5 (Significant prokaryotic OTU at remaining time points) and Figure S6 (Significant fungal OTU at remaining time points)

f) Section 5

-This section contains the R code for Figure 7 (Heatmap for significant organisms responding on Day 42 and nitrous oxide emissions on Day 42) and Figure S7 (Heatmap for significant organisms responding on Day 51 and nitrous oxide emissions on Day 51)
